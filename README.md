# Prerequires
1. nvm
2. node version 12.16.0
3. npm

# Steps

1. `nvm use`
* If you don't have the version into the .nvmrc you could execute the next command
`nvm install v12.16.0`

2. `npm install`

3. You must have a properties configuration, you could follow or copy the properties.example.json and create a properties.json, that is because of security username and password and this file is part of the gitignore

```
{
  "GOOD_USERNAME": "<SET YOUR VALID USER>",
  "GOOD_PASSWORD": "<SET YOUR VALID PASSWORD>"
}
```

4. Finally you should run the script `npm run test`
